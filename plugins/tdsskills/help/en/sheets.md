# TDS - Character Sheet

The `sheet` command lets you view your character sheet, showing your abilities.

> Learn how the TDS skills system works in the [TDS Tutorial](/help/tds).

`sheet` - Views your own sheet.
`sheet <name>` - Views someone else's sheet.
`sheet/<section> [<name>]` - Views just a specific section of someone's sheet or your own. 
  Valid sections are: attributes, action, background, languages, and (if enabled) advantages
  For example, `sheet/action` will view just action skills
