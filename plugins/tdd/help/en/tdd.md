# Trashcan's Difficult Dice

This game uses Trashcan's Difficult Dice, a plugin that sits on top of the FS3 system, Third Edition.  The complete guide to FS3 can be found online: [FS3 Player's Guide](http://www.aresmush.com/fs3/fs3-3).

## Base Mechanics

There are a few key differences between how FS3 treats dice and how TDD treats dice.

* **Dice Faces**: FS3 uses an 8-sided die and counts values above 6 as a 'Success', while TDD uses a 10-sided die and counts values above a 9 as a 'Success'. This makes TDD much more likely to produce failed rolls.
* **Botches and Critical Successes**: With TDD, any roll has a 5% chance of producing a 'Botch' (fails so badly that it produces the opposite intended outcome) and a 5% chance of producing a 'Critical Success' (succeeds spectactularly and against all odds). This introduces an element of risk for very highly ranked skill rolls and an element of hope for very low ones.
