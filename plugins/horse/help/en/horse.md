# Horse Basics
Horses are the primary method of transportation on Mars. Everyone in Virtue has access to the community stables, and receives a horse when they arrive on Mars or when they are old enough to ride, whichever comes first. 

## Getting a Horse
Your first horse is free. You can generate new qualities for your horse by using the command again, but it will overwrite your original horse's qualities. This costs 1 Luck Point. Renaming your horse and describing it are always free. 

## Commands
`horse [<name>]` - View your horse's qualities or someone else's.
`horse/get` - Obtain a horse.
`steed <name>` - Rename your horse.
`horse/desc <desc>` - Give your horse a more detailed description.
