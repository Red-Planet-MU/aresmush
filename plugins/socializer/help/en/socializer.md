# Pals

The Pals List is an easy way to let your character's close connections know that you're in an RP they could join if they'd like to. It is private and tracked by individual character, not handle. Your Pals will not know if you add or remove them from the list, or what other characters are on your list.

## Pals Commands

`pals` - Shows your Pals List.
`pals/add` - Adds a character to your Pals List.
`pals/remove` - Removes a character from your Pals List.
`pals/invite` - Notifies all of your Pals that they're able to join your active scene, if they're interested.
`pals/uninvite` - Notifies all of your Pals that you have closed the door to join your active scene.

# Open Scenes

By default, creating a new Open Scene will announce to the game so that interested parties can join. If you would like to toggle this behavior, simply use the following command.

`openscenes/announce <on or off>` - Toggles the Open Scene announcement on or off.
