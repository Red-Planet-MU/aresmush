# Serum Basics
Serums are the primary method of administering chemical agents to the body on Mars. A number of different types of serums have been synthesized to produce a range of effects.   Serums are administered by a quick-injection syringe. Individuals with some medical training are able to inject Revitalizer Serum more precisely, increasing its efficacy to the patient. The following have already been introduced and in common use on Mars for some time:

- **Revitalizer Serum**: 
- **Adreno Serum**:
- **Quickhand Serum**:
- **Hardy Serum**:
- **Glass Cannon Serum**:

## Getting Serums
Everyone in Virtue is given one dose of Revitalizer Serum per X from the community stockpiles. Additional serums can be obtained through the use of bargaining chits ICly, and are purchased with Luck OOCly.
